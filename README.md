# ðŸš€ KOSPI-Index-Predicting-Project__2022-summer

###Purpose : Analyze the correlation between the KOSPI index and economic indicators and use deep learning to predict the future KOSPI index.

###Participants :
Park Su Young (mak8mgt07@naver.com, https://github.com/vvvv1111vvvv)
Lee Donghwan(hwany1227@gmail.com,www.linkedin.com/in/donghwanlee7)

###Date Created :
2022.06.28 ~ 2022.07.18

###Roles :
Park Su Young : KOSPI Index Crawling/Processing, Data Correlation Analysis, Deep Learning & Performance Analysis
Lee Donghwan : Building Macroeconomics Index DB, Implementing Risk Analysis.

###Method:
(1) Crawl economic indicators on the Bank of Korea's web page and process them.
(2) Crawls the KOSPI index on the Naver finance and processes it
(3) Collect and Organize the data obtained in the previous step based on the business days between 2015.07.24 and 2022.07.01"
(4) Add GJR-GARCH(p,q) model value to the summarized data
(5) Normalize the organized data
(6) Analyze the organized data to identify the correlation,and modify the data structure to predict "1 day" with "5 days".
train_date: "2015.07.24 ~ 2021.06.30"
test_date: "2021.07.01 ~ 2022.07.01"
(7) Design Multi-layers with LSTM, Dense. Train Data with the Model. Compare the actual KOSPI value of 2021.07.01~2022.07.01 period with the predicted KOSPI value(1 day will be estimated by 5 days at CNN model), feature comparing graph and predictive performance index.
